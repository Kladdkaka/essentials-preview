buggy ass preview for essentials message config

thanks to @Spirit55555 for da php class https://github.com/Spirit55555/PHP-Minecraft

ok this is litterally the first php project (and the only thing i know in php is how to use echo and variables >_>) i've ever done so it's probably shitty made

instructions:
1. take the messages_en.properties from essentials jar
2. open it with notepad++
3. replace \u00A7 with &
4. use regex shit to add \n&r to the end of the lines (google if you dont know how)
5. now you download the files from here and put it in xampp or something
6. go to localhost/index.php and hopefully it should fucking work
7. when youre finished editing you just replace & with \u00A7 and u remove \n&r from every line

good fucking luck
